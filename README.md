A soon-to-be-released "advanced" accent picker for macOS

Current Stage: Pick accent colors for individual apps, if that's all you want out of this tool (Excluding iMac colors), feel free to test drive [Beta 2](https://github.com/forcequitOS/Aquifer/releases/tag/beta2) now (and make sure to give me feedback!).

The final release will be open source, supporing macOS 13.0 Ventura and later. Now *when* will the final release happen? Good luck.
