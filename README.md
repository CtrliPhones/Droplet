# Aquira

### The macOS accent color utility of the future, coming "soon".

![A screen recording of the Aquira application running on a Mac next to Mist and System Settings, showing how Mist's accent colors change after being selected in Aquira](https://github.com/forcequitOS/Aquira/blob/main/ProgressTwoPointOne.gif?raw=true)

Current Stage: Pick accent colors for individual apps, if that's all you want out of this tool (Excluding iMac colors), feel free to test drive [Beta 2](https://github.com/forcequitOS/Aquira/releases/tag/beta2) now (and make sure to give me feedback!).

The final release will be open source, supporing macOS 13.0 Ventura and later. Now *when* will the final release happen? Good luck.

You all have my official stamp of approval.

This project used to be called Aquifer, but I since renamed it to Aquira.... since why not, I guess.
